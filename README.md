# Python Fundamentals: Assignment 4

## 📌 Overview
This module marks the transition from procedural programming to *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)*. I learned how to model real-world entities using Classes and Objects, focusing on modularity, reusability, and security.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. OOP Foundations
* *Classes & Objects:* Blueprints and Instances.
* **The Constructor (__init__):** Initializing objects and understanding self.
* *Attributes:*
  * *Instance Attributes:* Unique to each object.
  * *Class Attributes:* Shared across all instances.

### 2. Methods
* *Instance Methods:* Regular methods that access self.
* *Class Methods:* Using @classmethod to access class-level data (cls).
* *Static Methods:* Using @staticmethod for utility functions (independent of class/instance).

### 3. The 4 Pillars of OOP
* *Encapsulation:* Restricting access to methods and variables (using private members __variable).
* *Inheritance:* Creating new classes from existing ones (Single, Multiple, and Multilevel inheritance).
* *Polymorphism:*
  * *Method Overriding:* Changing behavior of parent methods in child classes.
  * *Duck Typing:* "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck."
* *Abstraction:* Hiding complex implementation details using Abstract Classes.
